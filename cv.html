<em>Guides: Prof. Subray R. Hegde & Dr. Sumanth Govindarajan</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Developing an AI-powered application that analyses images of failed machine components, specifically shafts, to provide metallurgical failure analysis and actionable recommendations for preventing future failures.</li>
<li>Studied the most common mechanisms of shaft failures in industries and the fracture signatures of each type of failure on the fracture plane. Automated image retrieval from research papers using Linux shell scripting to build training and testing datasets.</li>
<li>Currently conducting a literature review on parameters for data labelling while creating a custom dataset and feature extraction methods for classification of the mechanism of shaft failures.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mrpl-failure-analysis">Metallurgical Failure Analysis - Industrial Cooling Fan</h3>
<p><em>MRPL, Mangalore | December 2024</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Contributed as a member of a three-person team from NITK, along with Prof. Subray Hegde & Dr. Sumanth Govindarajan, during an on-site visit to Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited (MRPL).</li>
<li>Inspected the failure of a Glass Fibre-Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) blade of one of the exhaust fans in the Process Cooling Towers - noted the operational history and recorded fracture signatures on the failed component.</li>
<li>Co-authored the Preliminary Investigation Report (PIR) and submitted to MRPL.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="auv-project">Autonomous Underwater Vehicle</h3>
<p><em>GUJCOST Robofest 5.0 | July 2025 – Present</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Co-designed the mechanical architecture and 3D CAD model of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) featuring modular thruster assemblies, buoyancy control pistons, and a gripper mechanism for object manipulation.</li>
<li>Performed structural optimization and component integration for enhanced hydrodynamic stability and load distribution, using iterative design analysis to ensure compactness and manufacturability of the AUV chassis.</li>
<li>Drafted comprehensive technical documentation detailing subsystem schematics, bill of materials, and mechanical design workflow.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>IEEE - NITK Chapter | October 2024 – April 2025</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Studied the working principles of Electron Microscopy (TEM & SEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). Explored the theory of energy bands in crystals and solutions of the Schrödinger Equation for specific cases: free electrons, bound electrons, tunnelling, and solid states.</li>
<li>Learnt simulation tools like ASE, VESTA, and abTEM to integrate computational methods for analysing electronic properties of materials and their structural representation, enabling cost-effective research independent of physical equipment and resource constraints.</li>
<li>Conducted simulations on materials such as GaAs, Re₆Se₈Cl₂, cubic BAs, SrTiO₃, Ag, Au, Hg, and conductive polymers (e.g., Polyaniline, PEDOT), computing properties like band structure and density of states.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pet-tiles">PET Tiles - The Waste to Wealth Saga!</h3>
<p><em>MT253: Principles of Extractive Metallurgy | April 2025 – May 2025</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Designed and implemented a sustainable process to convert discarded PET bottles into low-cost customizable tiles, serving as a proof-of-concept for decentralised circular waste management systems.</li>
<li>Recycled Polyethene Terephthalate/PET tiles were made using thermoplastic compression moulding. Waste PET bottles were shredded to 16 sq. cm., melted at 300°C, and poured into preheated stainless steel moulds under compressive load.</li>
<li>Fillers were added to enhance mechanical and aesthetic properties, followed by rapid water quenching to obtain durable tiles, thus converting PET waste into a functional product.</li>
